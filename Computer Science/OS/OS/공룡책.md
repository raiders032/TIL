# **Chapter 2** Operating-System Structures



#### shell scripts

Further, command- line interfaces usually make repetitive tasks easier, in part because they have their own programmability. For example, if a frequent task requires a set of command-line steps, those steps can be recorded into a file, and that file can be run just like a program. The program is not compiled into executable code but rather is interpreted by the command-line interface. These **shell scripts** are very common on systems that are command-line oriented, such as UNIX and Linux.
